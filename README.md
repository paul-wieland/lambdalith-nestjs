![Project Banner](assets/lambdalith_nestjs_banner.png)

## 🚀 Motivation

- ⚡ **Fast and cost-efficient** development and deployment using serverless infrastructure
- 🧪 Perfect fit for **prototypes and MVPs** that need to ship quickly
- 📦 Fully **Dockerized** for portability and reproducible builds
- 🔁 Combines **NestJS** with **API Gateway proxy integration**, enabling multiple endpoints within a single Lambda
- 🧩 **NestJS provides a full suite** of features like modularization, test frameworks, dependency injection
- 🔄 Provides a **smooth migration path** to containers or other compute environments later on
- 🚀 **Deploy in minutes**, not hours, days, or weeks
